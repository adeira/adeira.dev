As you can see we store all the code of this monorepo in `src` folder which contains additional subfolders for each tribe. You will spend most of the time there. All your work should be focused to your project inside your tribe (you can treat the subfolder in our tribe as an independent repository). Tools like Eslint and Flow (+ the whole testing system) is defined globally for everyone.

Basically, if you want to start a new project then just create a new folder under your tribe with new `package.json` and `src` folder and you are good to go: tests work, Eslint works, Flow works (all including CI). You can focus on your code without any distractions.

Notes:

1. https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/offline-mirror/
2. We require you to install Yarn version 1.0+ but the actual version used when working with Universe is defined in `.yarnrc` and it's stored in `.yarn/release`. Your local Yarn version us just an initial executor for the actual Yarn.
3. Flow typed folder is our code as well (even though it's generated by some tool). This means that if the definitions are not OK then fix them just like you'd write any other source code.
