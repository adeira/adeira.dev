Our monorepository is private by default due to sensitivity of the things we are working with. However, we like open-source and we try to make many sources publicly available. To make it happen we use our own [Monorepo Shipit](https://gitlab.skypicker.com/incubator/universe/tree/master/src/core/monorepo-shipit) which does all the hard work for us.

_TODO: describe some tech details about how to write custom configs with filters and modifiers_
