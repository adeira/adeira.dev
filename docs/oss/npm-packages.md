**Please Note!** You may get some Flow errors. We are trying to keep it on minimum but you may have incompatible Flow suppress comments. We currently don't know how to solve this issue well. One way how to tackle this issue is to have compatible `.flowconfig` options:

```ini
suppress_comment=\\(.\\|\n\\)*\\$FlowAllowDynamicImport
suppress_comment=\\(.\\|\n\\)*\\$FlowExpectedError: .+
suppress_comment=\\(.\\|\n\\)*\\$FlowIssue: https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/[0-9]+
suppress_comment=\\(.\\|\n\\)*\\$FlowPullRequest: https://github.com/facebook/flow/pull/[0-9]+

suppress_type=$FlowFixMe
```

Other Flow issues should be reported back.
